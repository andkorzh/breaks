This project is aimed to reverse engineer following integrated circuits:
- MOS 6502
- Ricoh 2A03 (known as NES APU)
- Ricoh 2C02 (known as NES PPU)

Project goals:
- Get complete transistor circuits ✅
- Convert transistor circuits to more high-level logic gates ✅
- Simulate circuits and write logic gate-level emulator (Moved to another repo - [Breaknes](https://github.com/emu-russia/breaknes))

The project has fully completed all its tasks, the repository will be used for some time to refine the schematics and rearrange them as HDL, but in general we can say that the research is complete.

## Why Breaks? 

We're breaking chips here :)
