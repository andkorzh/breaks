# Breaks - Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) / Famicom / Dendy chip reversing

This project is aimed to reverse engineer following integrated circuits:
- MOS 6502
- Ricoh 2A03 (known as NES APU)
- Ricoh 2C02 (known as NES PPU)

Project goals:
- Get complete transistor circuits
- Convert transistor circuits to more high-level logic gates
- Simulate circuits and write logic gate-level emulator

## Why Breaks?

We're breaking chips here :)
