# Dendy

**Dendy** is a collective name for the Chinese NES clones distributed in the CIS countries in the mid-to-late 90s.

The name "Dendy" came from the most elaborated clone produced by Steepler. All clones were produced somewhere in China and Taiwan.

It turned out that Nintendo did not want to deliver their licensed consoles to Russia, where bears and balalaikas lived at the time. So our compatriots stepped up and brought joy to our home. At the same time, they contributed to the spread of normal TV sets, replacing the Rubins and other junk.

Personally, the author had a clone in the form of a car, in the trunk of which a cartridge had to be stuffed, and the headlights acted as POWER/RESET buttons. The antenna output was inserted into the exhaust pipe :smiley: It was called Little Player Conexant.

Other continents (Latin American countries, Africa) also faced a similar fate and had their own clones ("phantoms", "tv games" etc). Here are some examples:

## Hardware features of clones

The main difference between the Dendy and compatible clones from the original is that the CPU was running at a frequency close to the NTSC NES, while the video system was running at PAL frequencies. Because of this, running PAL games were a bit "faster" than on the original PAL NES, so sometimes there were various bugs (flickering, freezing, and so on).

Also, the cartridge format was similar to the Japanese version of the Famicom. That is, a stab connector inserted from the top, not in the manner of a VCR like the European and American NES. The cartridges were usually "multi-game", with several games and menus to choose from.

Well, there are also some hardware differences in the inner workings of the chips, especially the APU:

How things were in other countries is not known.

## ICs

Clone chips were obtained by Chinese craftsmen by reversing the original series of chips RP-2A0n (APU) and RP-2C0n (PPU).

For example in the Dendy were UMC chips even on pins compatible with the originals: 6527 (analog RP2A03) and 6538 (analog RP2C07).

But later on, Chinese manufacturers started to make combined microcircuits, often with no housing, encapsulated in compound. In fact, the whole console was one "drop", the contacts from which went to the cartridge connector and the joypad ports.

## Modern times

Today handhelds with RGB LCD screen and hardware FPGA implementation are widespread. At the same time several games are usually saved in the built-in Flash memory.

Example (the author has one of these, it's a great device):

What's amazing is the cost of these devices is the same $20-30 as the clones in the 90's :smiley:
