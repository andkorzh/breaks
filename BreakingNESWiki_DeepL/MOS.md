**MOS Technology** is a now-defunct company that developed the 6502 processor.

The company was founded by several former developers of the Motorola 6800 processor.

The company's main products are vintage chips from the early PC era.

A hackneyed photo of the 6502 team with their brainchild:

In the background is an epic-sized circuit of 6502, in the hands of one of the colleagues apparently blanks for photomasks.
