# UMC 6538

Differences between UMC UA6538 PPU clone and reference PAL PPU (RP2C07).

## H Decoder

Not different from 2C07.

## V Decoder

It differs only in one output VPLA_4, which is triggered 50 lines later. The output is responsible for generating the `/VSET` signal, which is used by the PPU interrupt generation circuitry.

## EVEN/ODD

In fact, the circuit is so called because in the NTSC PPU it is responsible for the Dot Crawl. For PAL-like PPUs, this circuit does something else entirely, but the name remains the same.

The OAM1 address counter increment locking circuit in 6538 is disabled, although it is physically present on the chip. The circuit blocks attempts to write to OAM1 during VBLANK (from line 265 to 311).

## Sprite Eval

The OAM8 signal (address selection OAM1 or OAM2) has an additional buffer for signal amplification, as its trace has a decent length.

## DAC

The DAC is significantly redesigned, so the 6538 signal levels are different (a little brighter).

## What is NOT Different

The following circuit elements correspond to the reference PAL PPU 2C07:

- VBL signal output (via latch)
- BLNK in OAM Address
- W3 Enabler
- BLACK signal (additional logic is applied)
- Signal /PICTURE (there are additional latches).
- Chroma Decoder same
